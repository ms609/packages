<h3 id="fixing-typos">Fixing typos</h3>
<p>Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited
directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made
in the <em>source</em> file.</p>
<ul>
<li>DO: edit a roxygen comment in a <code>.R</code> file below
<code>R/</code>.</li>
<li>DON’T: edit an <code>.Rd</code> file below <code>man/</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an
issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If
you’ve found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug
with a minimal <a
href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex">reprex</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pull-request-process">Pull request process</h3>
<ul>
<li>We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request
(PR).<br />
</li>
<li>Look at the GitHub actions and CodeCovr build status before and
after making changes.</li>
<li>We follow <a
href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html">Google’s R style
guide</a></li>
<li>We use camelCase for variable names, and TitleCase for function
names.</li>
<li>We use the Oxford ending of ‘ize’ (not ‘ise’), and UK spelling
(e.g. ‘colour’) where it is not possible to avoid the distinction
(e.g. by shortening to ‘col’)</li>
<li>We use <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2">roxygen2</a> to build
documentation.<br />
</li>
<li>We use <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat">testthat</a>.
Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.<br />
</li>
<li>For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of
<code>NEWS.md</code> below the current development version header
describing the changes made followed by your GitHub username, and links
to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).</li>
</ul>
